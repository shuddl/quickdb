Project Overview
We aim to build a customizable AI workspace for teams and individuals, leveraging the
open-source Chatbot UI as the foundation. The final product should incorporate
advanced features inspired by platforms like TypingMind.com, including multi-model
support, automation agents, plugins, team & user permission management and
enterprise-grade collaboration tools.
Core Features to Implement
1. Enhanced Chat Interface
● Fork the existing Chatbot UI codebase and add:
○ Multi-Model Support: Integrate GPT-4, Claude, and Llama 2 (via APIs).
○ Thread Management: Searchable conversation history and folder
organization.
○ Custom Themes & Hotkeys: Allow users to personalize the UI.
○ Desktop App: Package as a cross-platform desktop app (e.g.,
Electron.js).
2. Agents & Automation
● Build a system for pre-built/custom AI agents to automate tasks (e.g., data
extraction, customer support).
● Enable low-code configuration (drag-and-drop or form-based).
● Integrate with third-party APIs (Slack, Google Sheets, CRM tools).
3. Plugin System
● Develop a plugin architecture for:
○ Third-Party Integrations (e.g., Google Search, Zapier).
○ Custom Plugins via REST API/webhooks.
● Ensure secure sandboxing for plugins.
4. Knowledge Base (KB) Integration
● Add document upload (PDF, CSV) and semantic search using a vector database
(e.g., pgvector).
● Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context-aware AI
responses.
5. Team Collaboration
● Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
● Team Management - Roles & Permissions
● Shared Workspaces: Collaborate on prompts, agents, and KBs.
● Usage Analytics: Track costs, API usage, and user activity.
6. Security & Compliance
● Add SSO/SAML authentication.
● Data encryption (at rest/in transit) and audit logs.
7. Settings
7.1 General Settings
Features:

○ Switch between OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Llama 2, etc.
○ Custom model endpoints (for on-prem/hosted models).
● Model Parameters:
○ Adjust temperature, max tokens, top-p, and frequency penalties.
○ Preset configurations (e.g., "Creative" vs. "Precise" modes).
● API Key Management:
○ Securely store and rotate API keys for different providers.
○ Usage quotas per key (e.g., limit monthly spend).
● Technical Implementation:
○ Encrypt API keys using AES-256 or similar.
○ Use environment variables for default model parameters.
7.3 Security & Privacy
Features:
● Authentication:
○ SSO/SAML integration (Okta, Google Workspace, Azure AD).
○ 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) for user accounts.
● Data Controls:
○ Toggle data retention policies (e.g., delete chats after 30 days).
○ GDPR compliance tools (user data export/deletion).
● Encryption:
○ Enable end-to-end encryption for sensitive conversations.
○ TLS/SSL enforcement for data in transit.
Technical Implementation:
● Use Auth0 or NextAuth.js for authentication flows.
● Implement audit logs for data access/deletion actions.
7.4 Team & Collaboration
Features:
● Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
○ Define roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) with granular permissions.
○ Restrict access to plugins, agents, or KBs by team.
● Workspace Management:
○ Invite/remove users, assign roles, and manage billing.
○ Shared resource quotas (e.g., API call limits per team).
Technical Implementation:
● Use PostgreSQL row-level security or Firebase Claims for RBAC.
● Integrate Stripe/Braintree for team billing.
7.5 Integrations & Plugins
Features:
● API Management:
○ Whitelist/block third-party domains for plugin security.
○ Monitor API call rates and errors.
● Plugin Settings:
○ Enable/disable plugins (e.g., Google Search, Zapier).
○ Configure plugin-specific parameters (e.g., API keys for CMS tools).
Technical Implementation:
● Sandbox plugins using Docker or Web Workers.
● Use OAuth2 for third-party integrations.
7.6 Compliance & Auditing
Features:
● Audit Logs:
○ Track user actions (logins, deletions, model changes)
○ Export logs to CSV/PDF for compliance reviews.
● Certifications:
○ Display compliance badges (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).
○ Data residency controls (choose server regions: EU, US, Asia).
Technical Implementation:
● Use AWS CloudTrail or a custom logging service.
● Deploy multi-region servers via AWS/GCP.
7.7 Notifications & Alerts
Features:
● Usage Alerts:
○ Notify users when approaching API quotas or spending limits.
● System Notifications:
○ Plugin/agent failure alerts (e.g., Slack/email integrations).
Technical Implementation:
● Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time alerts.
● Integrate with SendGrid or Resend for email notifications.
7.8 Advanced Settings
Features:
● Developer Mode:
○ Access to raw API request/response logs.
